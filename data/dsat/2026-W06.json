After receiving a few generic and non-specific responses, the issue eventually resolved itself after a couple of days, during which I spent a lot of time trying to fix it on my own.\n\nTo be honest, I believe that if you're aware of an issue affecting one of your products, it would be more helpful and respectful to proactively inform users, rather than relying solely on AI-generated replies.\n\nI also recently learned that, with the release of BIAS X, the software I purchased just a year ago will soon be considered outdated and no longer supported. I find this quite disappointing.\n\nFor these reasons, I\u2019ll be more cautious when considering the purchase of future Positive Grid products.\n\nBest regards",

Two weeks after it arrived your company changed the AI program. Now all the lovely sounds that I so enjoyed about the and in fact, told all of my friends about our gone. Now I have to go in and spend months figuring out how to work the AI program, I do not speak AI and don\u2019t know how to ask for these beautiful sounds me. I told many of my friends about this amazing app but now I just look at it in my room and think about all the work I have to do to get it to sound good. I was not satisfied with the answers I got from Devon your AI person.. I am not happy with the answers that I got from Ryan your regular human person. I am also not happy with my purchase. I wish I had not gone this direction. I am going to leave a review online and I will also not be recommending this product to anybody that I know..",

      "comment": "In the latest release of the software I was forced to upgrade.  The upgrade would not work as apparently my IOS is too old.  It would be nice to have a published policy on how long the software would last. The solution given was to upgrade to IOS 15 (from IOS 12).  In order to do that I have to buy a new iPad so very costly.  I'd like a couple of things, one, don't force me to run an upgrade as the only option before starting the program and two would like to hear how you decide an operating system is too old.  It basically killed my iPad.  ios 12 support ended in 2023 and then was extended.  On the positive side on this ticket, when I submitted a ticket I got a response back in a couple of hours.  I had estimated it to be a week, so that part is good.  My question now would be if I buy a new iPad how long will Spark app be supported on it as the only function of my ipad is to run the Spark app (which is terrific by the way).  Thanks",

      "comment": "I reached out for support regarding an issue with BIAS FX 2 \u2014 ToneCloud suddenly stopped working without any clear reason. After receiving a few generic and non-specific responses, the issue eventually resolved itself after a couple of days, during which I spent a lot of time trying to fix it on my own.\n\nTo be honest, I believe that if you're aware of an issue affecting one of your products, it would be more helpful and respectful to proactively inform users, rather than relying solely on AI-generated replies.\n\nI also recently learned that, with the release of BIAS X, the software I purchased just a year ago will soon be considered outdated and no longer supported. I find this quite disappointing.\n\nFor these reasons, I\u2019ll be more cautious when considering the purchase of future Positive Grid products.\n\nBest regards",

      "comment": "When I received the amp, I was very happy with it. It had these beautiful icons in the AI area and all these lovely preset sounds available. Two weeks after it arrived your company changed the AI program. Now all the lovely sounds that I so enjoyed about the and in fact, told all of my friends about our gone. Now I have to go in and spend months figuring out how to work the AI program, I do not speak AI and don\u2019t know how to ask for these beautiful sounds me. I told many of my friends about this amazing app but now I just look at it in my room and think about all the work I have to do to get it to sound good. I was not satisfied with the answers I got from Devon your AI person.. I am not happy with the answers that I got from Ryan your regular human person. I am also not happy with my purchase. I wish I had not gone this direction. I am going to leave a review online and I will also not be recommending this product to anybody that I know..",
