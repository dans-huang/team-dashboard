Not to speak about your pathetic advice to check for version updates regularly, or to make a thorough documentation by video, just tonaee, how a program crashes. I have reproduced this issue on multiple other systems (3), showed my system and ASIO set-up. Besides I am sure no one will read this feedback, so I will feel free to share my experience with BIAS X in my producing and band community online and offline. ",

It is certainly not their fault that the app being \"upgraded\" would make it non-functional for users not using IOS 16 or above. it does make one mindful of the fact that if one purchases your companies products in the future this will probably happen every time. One will be required to purchase a $500 cell phone, or tablet in order to keep updating a $300 amp. It seems like a chase for folly. I was perfectly happy with my amp as it was and as I had paid for it. Now that amp does less than the amp that it replaced and certainly A LOT less than the amp that I initially purchased. I was offered a $20 gift certificate towards new product by the person in customer service. This is extremely ironic in light of the fact that I have a base level product in your companies line up and what I really need now due to the update your company has performed is as new phone. My current one is useless. So am I to buy a newer updated amp with the coupon so that it will also not work with my current IOS? I have made far worse mistake than buying your product and it did provide me with joy when it did what it was designed to do. Now it is an expensive blue tooth speaker with some pre-set applications. Good luck with your new business model. I ",
