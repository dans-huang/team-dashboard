      "comment": "So, the Spark GO isn't capable of recognizing a wired microphone. Okay. Seems like a serious missed opportunity, but what do I know? However, suggesting that I consider purchasing another device that costs more than 5x what the device I'd originally purchased is just absolute bonkers. What exactly would make someone think I'd be able to afford the Spark LIVE when I originally submitted a support request for the Spark GO? I mean, I am clearly interested in something that's small, battery powered, and affordable. The Spark LIVE meets 33% of the criteria -- why suggest that to begin with? I dunno. Call me crazy or nitpicky, but I just felt totally misunderstood after reading that. That, and really bummed. Sure, I'd love to be able to purchase an amplifier that costs more than most decent laptops. Just not sure what, aside from me mentioning that I needed something for vocals, would lead someone to be all like \"You should totally go with this other thing that is WAY outside of your apparent price point AND entirely overdelivers on what your apparent needs are.\" Just me? Okay.",

It does not do so with mob other guitars, even those that have a battery pre-amp as in the Ovation and the Emerald, but they are tow of my most used instruments, so I fear I will have to find another wireless system. I am surprised because I played my Emerald through a friend's Link system this fall, which is what made me want to order a set. It is too bad, because In like your products, have three of your amps and they have worked out great, but this system does not seem to do the job for me.",
