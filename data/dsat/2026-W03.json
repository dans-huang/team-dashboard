If it has a cover and I don't think it has, it is so thick Popeye wouldn't be able to shift it and I'm not going to force it and risk damaging it just because you won't listen. What do you make hard to find it for in the first place? I connect to my phone in the app so why don't you include the serial number there? I'm logged in. Surely it can't be hard to link my account and serial number. It is a perennial problem that companies create problems and then pretend they haven't by saying 'do this' as if that is accurate and easy which it rarely is. I was going to give this feedback in response until I saw it says 'Devin' is not a real person. It's good that you make clear you are using AI support but it stifles feedback and dialogue.",
