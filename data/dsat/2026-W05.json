However, being told to follow a lengthy set of more and more impractical steps to try to solve the issue as if it was somehow a problem on my end, when it clearly was an issue regarding (and ultimately resolved by) a software \"update\" that broke the product, was a bad idea. It would be a lot better if, when you break something, which happens in software development all the time, you just own the problem, and work on a fix, instead of gaslighting your customers with impractical ideas like trying a different WiFi network, which of course, won't fix broken software anyway... it's just busy work.\n\nSo: very satisfied that you fixed it farily quickly, very dissatisfied with the initial response that this was an issue of my usage of the product. Hence, neutral. Love the product, though!",

A satisfactory resolution was not provided.\n\nOverall, this was one of the worst examples of customer service I\u2019ve experienced. Not only was interacting with Positive Grid deeply subpar, but it\u2019s also given me a negative impression of your brand. If it takes 9 days for a response to the simplest of issues, then I have little confidence in receiving support should there ever be a matter of greater concern with one of your products. Beyond unacceptable and disappointing, and makes me want to sell all my Positive Grid gear.",

It would be nice to have a published policy on how long the software would last. The solution given was to upgrade to IOS 15 (from IOS 12).  In order to do that I have to buy a new iPad so very costly.  I'd like a couple of things, one, don't force me to run an upgrade as the only option before starting the program and two would like to hear how you decide an operating system is too old.  It basically killed my iPad.  ios 12 support ended in 2023 and then was extended.  On the positive side on this ticket, when I submitted a ticket I got a response back in a couple of hours.  I had estimated it to be a week, so that part is good.  My question now would be if I buy a new iPad how long will Spark app be supported on it as the only function of my ipad is to run the Spark app (which is terrific by the way).  Thanks",

The replacement has had connectivity issues throughout which have got progressively worse. I'd love one of your larger amps, but have decided not to buy one based on the issues I've had with the Spark Mini.\nRegarding you customer service, your AI initially responded to my request asking me questions I had already answered. I responded by asking to speak to a human, and your AI responded to that saying it was a human. I found that whole interaction frustrating.\n\nTo sum up, the amp sounds great but I won't be buying another Positive Grid product ",

I then asked for a human and AI said someone would get back to me.  This was several days ago.  I got an email yesterday saying that someone would help me but they had a lot of requests.  I'm not that tech savvy (I'm 74 years old) but I've tried many times to resolve the issue on my own without success.  It's unfortunate because the spark 40 amp is really awesome when it's working properly.",
