Offering new customers virtually the same price as returning customers are offered for upgrades/loyalty pricing is very much an insult to your existing customer base, many of whom would be eligible for the current upgrade pricing. Why not offer at least a token discount of say, 10-15% off the current upgrade price to keep everyone happy and prevent issues like this from arising. I know not everyone would be satisfied even with that, but you would most certainly have many, many more happy campers out there than you do now. And support not offering anything other than a \"There, there, it will be alright - we really do care about our loyal customers\" is, quite frankly, very irritating.",

I literally haven't even unboxed your product yet,  I really wanted to get the Spark 2 bag but I can't afford it because getting into guitar is expensive. \nI bought from a respected dealer, did what I was supposed to do and then few weeks later everyone else gets the bag included free. I understand that its your website deal but as I've never even used the amp yet my first Postive Grid experience feels very negative, showing up in my feed about 1 week after receiving shipment I feel bit taken advantage of. Sorry I know its not your direct fault but looking at my Spark 2 makes me genuinely regret buying it. I haven't used it once its still in the box \nThank you for listening ",

A month.  How can I in good confidence buy more of your products when you take a month to support what I\u2019ve already purchased.  Two 40\u2019s, four powered cabs, one Live.  I love them!  Until I have to undo all of my cable management and drag them to my office, download software updaters and drivers onto my personal computer and do firmware updates.  Is this a Cisco aggregate router or a guitar amp?  Okay okay, it\u2019s the future, I\u2019m old, I can concede that point.  But when you take a MONTH to fix the break that you forced me to implement, there was no \u201copt out\u201d of the update option.  When you forced me into a failed state, man.  All of my musical mojo fades away and all that is left is financial regret.  A month fellas.  Are you catching that part?  I want to love, promote and support this platform.  I do.  I want to.

Within hours of my order being placed you dropped the price by a huge amount and refused to price adjust for me even though my package had not even left the warehouse.
