I understand that its your website deal but as I've never even used the amp yet my first Postive Grid experience feels very negative, showing up in my feed about 1 week after receiving shipment I feel bit taken advantage of. Sorry I know its not your direct fault but looking at my Spark 2 makes me genuinely regret buying it. I haven't used it once its still in the box \nThank you for listening ",

I love the Positive Grid products but would definitely think very carefully before I would buy any now due to this. ",

WhoTF needs that?) and the price offered 2 days later feels like the LOWEST effort possible.

The order was shipped three days later so the excuse that these orders get processed quickly is bogus.  Instead I was told to refuse the order at the door or send it back for a refund.
