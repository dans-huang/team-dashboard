So I reached out to you back and said, I missed the sale by one day because it took so long for you to reply my original request, can you honor the one day old sale price and I will actually end up ordering more products.

You could have troubleshooting information for this problem. I'm still not sure the problem was at my end. You make it sound like it couldn't possibly be a fault at your end.\n\nIn response to the aspect of not being able to find the serial number, the reply from your AI support said I should do what I had already explained is impossible which is to pull back the cover on the Spark Go. If it has a cover and I don't think it has, it is so thick Popeye wouldn't be able to shift it and I'm not going to force it and risk damaging it just because you won't listen. What do you make hard to find it for in the first place? I connect to my phone in the app so why don't you include the serial number there? I'm logged in. Surely it can't be hard to link my account and serial number. It is a perennial problem that companies create problems and then pretend they haven't by saying 'do this' as if that is accurate and easy which it rarely is. I was going to give this feedback in response until I saw it says 'Devin' is not a real person. It's good that you make clear you are using AI support but it stifles feedback and dialogue.",

      "comment": "I appreciated the quick responses, both from the AI agents and your staff but the resolution to this problem was unsatisfactory for me and I have had to return the product due to a fairly short-sighted and unadvertised decision to include a 15 minute power-off feature - something that was not advertised and is not present on your competitors products and which makes it unsuitable for live use (especially in my church music setting).\n\nI have provided quite a lot of feedback which I hope goes into your planning, should you re-issue or create a new version, however there was no suggestion of how Positive Grid might try to retain my brand loyalty (which was fairly high as I love my Spark Go and admire many of your other products).\n\nI have since had to purchase a more expensive Boss equivalent (that has a far more reasonable 1 hour timeout), which is more practical for my usage but lacks some of the finesse that I admired. Although I appreciate that changing these things is difficult, I was still surprised by the lack of commitment that was shown to trying to fix things - for example even being asked if I might be interested in testing any potential new versions in the future.",

You could have troubleshooting information for this problem. I'm still not sure the problem was at my end. You make it sound like it couldn't possibly be a fault at your end.\n\nIn response to the aspect of not being able to find the serial number, the reply from your AI support said I should do what I had already explained is impossible which is to pull back the cover on the Spark Go. If it has a cover and I don't think it has, it is so thick Popeye wouldn't be able to shift it and I'm not going to force it and risk damaging it just because you won't listen. What do you make hard to find it for in the first place? I connect to my phone in the app so why don't you include the serial number there? I'm logged in. Surely it can't be hard to link my account and serial number. It is a perennial problem that companies create problems and then pretend they haven't by saying 'do this' as if that is accurate and easy which it rarely is. I was going to give this feedback in response until I saw it says 'Devin' is not a real person. It's good that you make clear you are using AI support but it stifles feedback and dialogue.",
