Multiple contacts with customer support resulted in me being shipped an incorrect cable twice. Upon contacting customer support a third time, it was finally confirmed which cable was needed but I was told this cable is out of stock and would be mailed to me as soon as it became available. The process was cumbersome and customer service mailed me wrong items twice even after I clearly explained which cable I needed. Needless to say, I\u2019m very unimpressed with the service I received. I was offered a $20 coupon code toward the purchase of new Positive Grid merchandise, but since the product line\u2019s recent price increases, the $20 coupon fails to offer any meaningful compensation for the continued poor service.",

While waiting for your reply, bunch of items went for sale which were not exactly what I needed, but I could satisfy my needs if I bought even more items. The reply finally came after 5 days, practically saying we won't do custom bundles but here is $20 off (appx 1% off the goods I wanted to buy). Well I thought ok, I will purchase the goods via the sales. But I lost my opportunity by one day while waiting for your reply. In other words the sales were gone. Additionally one of the products I wanted to order the price went up by $50. So I reached out to you back and said, I missed the sale by one day because it took so long for you to reply my original request, can you honor the one day old sale price and I will actually end up ordering more products. The answer was no but I can still give you $20 off. Thanks  ",

Although I appreciate that changing these things is difficult, I was still surprised by the lack of commitment that was shown to trying to fix things - for example even being asked if I might be interested in testing any potential new versions in the future.",

You say it is a known issue, but you have not fixed anything. I ask for my money back and you send me this survey. \nI have 15 amp programs on the computer I use, none have any issues. Only yours, it cant sign in. Please send a real fix, or refund my money. This has ruined all respect for positive Grid..\nPlease prove me wrong.",

I think I deserve the sale price.\nGD\nResponse:       Hello Gregory,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding the recent price change on the Spark GO. I understand your concern about the price adjustment happening so soon after your purchase yesterday.\n\nCurrently, we don't have a policy in place for price adjustments or matching for recent orders when promotions occur. Because of this, we are unable to offer a refund for the price difference between your purchase price and the current sale price.\n",

While waiting for your reply, bunch of items went for sale which were not exactly what I needed, but I could satisfy my needs if I bought even more items. The reply finally came after 5 days, practically saying we won't do custom bundles but here is $20 off (appx 1% off the goods I wanted to buy). Well I thought ok, I will purchase the goods via the sales. But I lost my opportunity by one day while waiting for your reply. In other words the sales were gone. Additionally one of the products I wanted to order the price went up by $50. So I reached out to you back and said, I missed the sale by one day because it took so long for you to reply my original request, can you honor the one day old sale price and I will actually end up ordering more products. The answer was no but I can still give you $20 off. Thanks  ",

Although I appreciate that changing these things is difficult, I was still surprised by the lack of commitment that was shown to trying to fix things - for example even being asked if I might be interested in testing any potential new versions in the future.",

You could have troubleshooting information for this problem. I'm still not sure the problem was at my end. You make it sound like it couldn't possibly be a fault at your end.\n\nIn response to the aspect of not being able to find the serial number, the reply from your AI support said I should do what I had already explained is impossible which is to pull back the cover on the Spark Go. If it has a cover and I don't think it has, it is so thick Popeye wouldn't be able to shift it and I'm not going to force it and risk damaging it just because you won't listen. What do you make hard to find it for in the first place? I connect to my phone in the app so why don't you include the serial number there? I'm logged in. Surely it can't be hard to link my account and serial number. It is a perennial problem that companies create problems and then pretend they haven't by saying 'do this' as if that is accurate and easy which it rarely is. I was going to give this feedback in response until I saw it says 'Devin' is not a real person. It's good that you make clear you are using AI support but it stifles feedback and dialogue.",
